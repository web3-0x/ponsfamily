/**
 * @title PonsV2BondingCurve
 * @notice Constant-product bonding curve for one v2 launch, adapted from
 * BootstrapPool.sol (code-423n4/2025-01-iq-ai). The curve trades against the
 * same quote asset its graduated Uniswap V4 pool will use: native ETH when
 * `pairToken` is the zero address, otherwise that ERC-20. Collecting the
 * eventual pool asset from the very first trade is what lets graduation seed
 * the pool directly, with no swap and therefore no price oracle anywhere in
 * the system.
 *
 * Every trade fee is charged against the quote leg regardless of trade
 * direction, so the curve never accrues fees denominated in the memecoin:
 * protocol and creator revenue is quote-denominated from the first trade,
 * before graduation ever happens. Fees are split and swept through the same
 * protocol/creator/buyback-and-lock policy the post-graduation hook uses,
 * read from `feePolicy` so both phases behave identically.
